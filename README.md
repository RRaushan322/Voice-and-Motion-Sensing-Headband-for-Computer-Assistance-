## How It Works

1. **Head Motion Detection**:
   - The gyroscope captures head movements such as pitch, roll, and yaw.
   - The Xiao ESP32-C3 processes this data to move the cursor on the screen.

2. **Voice Command Processing**:
   - The VC-02 module interprets predefined voice commands.
   - Commands trigger specific actions like left-click, right-click, copy, and paste.

3. **Wireless Connectivity**:
   - The system communicates wirelessly with the computer via BLE, ensuring minimal latency.
   - The Arduino Pro Micro translates received signals into executable inputs.
